This repo contains a Shiny App which may be used for strategic (long term) asset allocation.

We say (or Markowitz said!) that a portfolio is efficient when it gives the "maximum return for a given risk, or minimum risk for given return", where the risk of a portfolio is measured by the variance of the returns. 

Stock prices are downloaded from Yahoo FINANCE and are **monthly** aggregated,  thus returns are also computed on monthly frequency.

The app provides return and risk (variance) of **1000** simulated portfolios (each with different weights).

The user can choose among a set of possible securities so as to build its best portfolio.
